## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/) - For font styles


### What I learned

Using the combination of button and hover, I make the bottons of my page clean and interactable. I'll make it to the real time work.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div id="button-container" class="inter-font">

      <button id="github">GitHub</button>

      <button id="frontent_mentor">Frontend Mentor</button>

      <button id="linkedin">LinkedIn</button>

      <button id="twitter">Twitter</button>

      <button id="instagram">Instagram</button>

    </div>
```
```css
button{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    color: white;
    width: 300px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-weight: 600;
    font-size: 14px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

button:hover{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 30%);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('Not one')
}
```


### Continued development
